            <p>
                In 2067, a global famine caused humanity to abandon scientific pursuits such as space exploration. Ex-NASA pilot <em>Joseph Cooper</em>
                 is forced to work as a farmer. One day, Cooper experiences a gravitational "anomaly" in his daughter Murph's be-
                droom. He deduces it to be a pattern of GPS coordinates and arrives at a secret NASA facility headed by <em>Professor Brand.</em>
                Brand explains to Cooper that it is engaged in a secret mission to discover an exoplanet capable of supporting life and that
                he is working on a gravity-equation. He enlists Cooper's help to pilot an exploratory spacecraft with three other scientists, Ro-
                milly, Doyle, and Brand’s daughter Amelia. The crew travels through a wormhole on board the Endurance to pass through to
                another galaxy. Their mission is to investigate three planets, orbiting a supermassive black hole called Gargantua, each of
                which was previously explored by a NASA scientist-explorer.
